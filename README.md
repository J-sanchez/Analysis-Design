## Overview

In this course, we completed several projects that involved critical aspects of data structures and algorithms. Below are two project worked on for this course

## Project Submissions

### Project One: Analysis of Data Structures

In this project, we analyzed the run-time and memory efficiency of various data structures. The analysis conducted highlights the performance implications of different data structures in various scenarios.

- **File:** `6.2_Project_One_Jonathan_Sanchez.docx`
- **Description:** This document contains a detailed analysis of the time complexity and space complexity associated with different data structures used in the project.

### Project Two: Sorting and Printing Courses

For this project, you implemented a sorting algorithm to order a list of courses in the Computer Science program alphanumerically. This demonstrates your ability to work with sorting algorithms and manage lists.

- **File:** `ProjectTwo.cpp`
- **Description:** This C++ script implements a hash map to store computer science courses. The program allows the user to load a file, prints out a list of Computer Science courses, and allows the user to search for a specific course.

## Reflection

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In the course, we tackled problems involving the optimization and efficient management of data through the use of various data structures and algorithms. Project One required us to assess the efficiency of different data structures in terms of runtime and memory usage, while Project Two focused on the implementation.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

To approach these problems, I first needed to understand the fundamental properties and performance characteristics of different data structures. Data structures are crucial because they provide efficient ways to store, manage, and access data, which is essential for optimizing performance and resource usage in software applications. 

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

During the course, I had to grasp the trade-offs between different data structures. I am used to using SQL to handle data. To overcome these roadblocks, I had to humble myself and research the algorthms and data structures to fully understand their functionalities. 

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on these projects has helped me become more humble and return to the basics. I do not like to write pseudocode and I do not like coding small projects. However, I now have a greater appreciation for what I would have previously called mundane algorithms or steps. I tend to overlook the foundation of an algorithm in search of a grander solution or because I simply want to build something "cool". I now appreciate the importance of the fundamental algorthms as they are stepping stones that the majority of complex functionalities are built on.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I do not think these projects will directly impact how I approach development or problem solving. However, I think they will help me develop a different perspective when I am stuck on a problem or discussing solutions.
